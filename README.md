# Deep Learning practice using TORCH

This is the deep learning repo.
In this repository, you can find tutorials of Deep Learning architecture using PyTorch.

Some of the networks/techniques that I've learned are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Transfer Learning,
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Character-Level-RNN Classification and Generation, Sequence-to-Sequence Network with Attention.

I have also created UNESCO10 dataset so that CNN can be implemented on it.
